# Pi3_SLAM
Prototype of a SLAM system build on top of Ï€^3


Works for odometry, examples will follow...

## ToDo

 - integrate Open3D robust ICP with scaling=True
 - [] Test SL(4) solver from vggt-slam
 - [] Upload GoPro samples
 - [] Eval on Euroc
 - [] Loop closures, but not that relevant
 - [] Localize a second camera to the reconstructed one
 - [] scale using GPS priors
 - [] align to Gravity with Imu priors
 -
